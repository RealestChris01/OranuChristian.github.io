                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Christian Oranu, an Operations & Technology Specialist with a proven ability to optimize processes and scale solutions.

<p>My foundation is built on 3+ years of experience in fast-paced remote operations, spanning executive support, project coordination, and high-level customer service. I bring the clarity, structured thinking, and resourcefulness honed in those roles, managing CRM systems, executing email campaigns, and solving complex support issues and apply it to technical infrastructure.</p>

<p>I specialize in Cloud Automation and System Optimization, leveraging core DevOps tools to build and secure reliable environments. My technical skillset includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, Containerization with Docker, and Advanced Git Workflows, all used to ensure efficient, scalable, and reproducible technical solutions.</p>

<p>Clients and colleagues often say, 'He makes complex situations look easy.' That’s because I approach every task, whether it’s organizing internal workflows or deploying cloud infrastructure, with a systemic mindset. I don’t just check boxes; I bridge gaps between technical needs and operational goals to drive meaningful results.</p>
</p>
